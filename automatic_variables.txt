$@  The file name of the _target_ of the rule.  In a pattern rule
    that has multiple targets (see Introduction to Pattern Rules),'$@'
    is the name of whichever target caused the rule's recipe to be
    run.

$<  The name of the first prerequisite. If the target got its recipe
    from an implicit rule, this will be the first prerequisite added
    by the implicit rule (see Implicit Rules).

$?   The names of all the prerequisites that are newer than the
    target, with spaces between them. 

$^  The names of all the unique prerequisites, excluding order-only
    prerequisites.

$|  The names of all the order-only prerequisites.

$+  Like '$^', but prerequisites listed more than once are duplicated
    in the order they were listed in the makefile. 

$*  The stem with which an implicit rule matches.  For complex matches,
    the stem might not be what you expect...
